## 🎯 Objectives

- Preprocess and clean the electric load dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends  
- Train machine learning and deep learning models for load forecasting  
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² Score  
- Predict electric load for new or unseen data
